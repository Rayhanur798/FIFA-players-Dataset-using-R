# FIFA Player Data Cleaning and Analysis (R)

This project was part of a university assignment where I was given a messy dataset of over 1,000 FIFA players. The goal was to clean the data and perform basic exploratory analysis using R — a language I had to learn quickly for this task.

## Objective
- Clean a raw dataset containing duplicate, fake, and inconsistent player data
- Analyze and visualize key information like positions, wages, and player distribution

## What I Did
- Removed duplicate and fake entries
- Filtered the dataset to keep only useful records
- Used dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualizations

## Visuals Included
- Histograms of player wages
- Pie charts and bar plots for player positions
- Summary of top earning players

## Tools Used
- R and RStudio
- tidyverse (mainly dplyr and ggplot2)
- readr for loading the dataset

## Note
This project is not fully complete and was done while I was still learning R as part of my first year at university. It’s not perfect, but I tried my best to apply what I had learned in a short amount of time.

I'll likely revisit and improve this project as I gain more experience in R and data analysis.

Thanks for checking it out!
